## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media queries
- Fluid typography

### What I learned

- Breakpoints should always be handled explicitly: trying to exploit "natural" wrapping instead of media queries is not maintainable.
- Font size can be dynamic based on the viewport size (fluid typography);

### Continued development

- Sass project structure
- Responsive layouts
- Mobile-first development

### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap responsive breakpoints](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/overview/#responsive-breakpoints) - On certain high-dpi devices, the screen size can be fractional and fall between two media queries, breaking the layout.
